# Ender's modified Code of Merit

1. The project creators, lead developers, and core team, constitute
the managing members of the project and have final say in every decision
of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous decisions.
There are no limitations to this decisional power.

2. All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want
within the project. 

3. This is a space for technical prowess; topics outside of the project
will not be tolerated.

4. Non technical conflicts will be discussed in a separate space. Disruption
of the project will not be allowed.

5. Individual characteristics, including *but not limited to*,
body, sex, sexual preference, species, race, language, religion, nationality,
sentience, or political preferences are **irrelevant** in the scope of the project,
and will not be taken into account concerning your value or that
of your contribution to the project.

6. **Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.**

7. There is no room for ambiguity: Ambiguity will be met with questioning;
further ambiguity may be met with silence. It is the responsibility
of the originator to provide requested context.

8. This Code of Merit does not take precedence over the governing laws that apply
to you and/or the project and project creators.

9. This Code of Merit governs the technical procedures of the project, not the 
activities outside of it.

10. Participation in the project equates to agreement of this Code of Merit.

11. Fallacious arguments will not be tolerated; at least they will be ignored.
